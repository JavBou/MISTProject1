## Problem Description

Our task was to construct a relational database for a football club. Our central entity, teams, represents the numerous teams that are formed within the football club. These teams are comprised of players, coaches, and sponsors, all of whom participate in numerous matches. We're also modeling other aspects surrounding the teams, such as social media, injuries, etc. Our goal is to accurately model these various relationships, generating sample data sets, and populating our table and attributes with the same data to showcase the performance and effectiveness of the model. We're also aiming to perform various queries on this data model to highlight key metrics and insights surrounding the operations and functionality of the football club.
